<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Recently, both DICOM and HL7 have published web specifications, DICOM web and HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), which is easier to be adopted by IT system developers and sharing medical image or related data across departments. This journal plans to develop a standard web solution for medical images and annotation sharing. The web solution has some essential functions such as zoom-in, zoom-out, and adjusting the contrast of medical images. The system could also be used for making annotations on medical images. According to the specification of FHIR observation resource, the annotations would be XML formatted and could be stored in FHIR server. The FHIR-based annotations could be referenced by FHIR-based image findings. This constitutes a FHIR-based web viewer solution that can be integrated with DICOM web server for retrieving and viewing medical images. FHIR uses HTTP protocol as an exchange protocol which is a developer-friendly method for sharing and accessing clinical information. Using FHIR as a standard for a more clinically integrated system in the field of radiology would be easier for implementation, understanding, and management.
